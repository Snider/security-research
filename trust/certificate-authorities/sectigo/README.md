# Sectigo EV SSL Validation Issues.

I wont be updating this page until the 1st Feb; heres a highlight.

- Faceless trust provider by proxy
- no validation agent knowledge continuity
- Incorect interpritation of [EV Code Signing Certificate Guidelines](https://cabforum.org/wp-content/uploads/CA-Browser-Forum-EV-Guidelines-1.7.8.pdf) enabling cert issuence "edge cases" 

I welcome chats about the issue, with correct entities prior to the 1st, I have inrifuatable evedence to back my case, is not Slander, UK Law was not upheald and my Privacy attempted to be violated.

This cost me in the thousaounds, add in lost time... Can you put a price on making inventing the Web3 network almost mentally impossible?

I will be looking at personal damages, this affected my health and ability to give back to my community.

I'm very serious, this is a statement of intent.
