# UK Companies House Public Dataset Privacy Modifications

The UK is a complex system; people from outside wont get the nouaunces we were raise in.

We have a single company register and governing body [Companies House](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house), we have laws that dictate certain 
behaviours all companies must abide by, these include but not limited to:

Due to the public imutable nature of the public record; It is permmited to use PHYSICAL Office as a Service offerings by select mail companies, that abide by company law and 
must direct all govermental mail regardless of the account state. This is why that service costs more, you rent a PHYSICAL space and the efective Lanlord is bound by Law to ensure contact.

This is done to protect other people, or vunrable people from Public data, as the address would quite often be the Directors home address; The UK Goverment knows exactly how to reach any company.

Companies House is essentially a Gaurdian for both sides of bussines interest they regulate.
