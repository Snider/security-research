# CryptoNote is Confidential & NOT private

Firstly, let's define these two words because, as always, the devil is in the details.

## Privacy 
`a state in which one is not observed or disturbed by other people`

## Confidential 
`intended to be kept secret.`

# Technically Correct Naming

A `private_key` is required for all actions, the chain entrusted with keeping your data a secret. 

This ID tracks your every interaction, but only with a known key.

That you can lose, others guess it or find it floating after a boating accident; while not statistically likely, it's not impossible, making it impossible to be private.

You act in `Private` using the chain's `Confidentiality`.

Another analogy is the difference between VPNs and TOR; VPNs are confidential, and TOR is private.

In a legal sense, looking with uneducated eyes, it seems geared toward thwarting Private Secrets(TOR) while allowing Secrets(VPN).

The courts in any jurisdiction gain more power; they can request information be disclosed at the right and proper time, as per the local laws intended by Judges.

Confidentiality chains have a massive PR issue over people with 2nd language understanding of English deciding to use Private over Confidential.

Understandable, but by word definition, CryptoNote is not and can not be private, making Lethean, Haven, Monero, Zano etc, all Confidential chains, not Private chains.
