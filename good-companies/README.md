## Docker Inc
https://www.docker.com/ At a time where the sugbject of my work was frowned on, Docker looked at us, what i wanted to do, and gave us OpenSource support... I dont have a bad word to say about them, just prior to locking down they added lots of "unrestricted namespaces" for OpenSource, and im thankful they took us on.

## GitLab
https://gitlab.com GitLab is great for DevOps; development i still think GitHub has the edge... but for profesional use, GitLab is a solid choice, with a different feature set that suits DevOps vs Coding. We use it at LetheanVPN to seprate devs who dont like to talk from public; the two work well together, worth checking out.
