# Words

Ok, it's been interesting gauging the response to ideas(then projects) on Twitter; I got a good idea of direction now from twitter and talks etc.

I'm going back to the new GUI / VPN. If you are interested in helping, then the projects talked about recently are some of the things we can do on top of the new network I'm mainly going to work on now; I'm finding it hard to explain the system; our new network, so more accessible to just explain it in code. 

The other projects on GitHub are kinda "out there" for taking as a pet project. Eventually, the things I'm interested in doing have been discussed/added... I will get around to it; even `4hash/` so, in RFC style... 

Kind of leaving the floor open for people to get creative; I got work to do, can't be doing all this dilly-dallying getting interest.... so leaving this here; if you want to help or work on a thing, we are open to all, ask to join the community team(or email darbs@lt.hn|snider@lt.hn) alongside an item you want to change (on GitHub PR/code/self-actionable-plan/bored-brain-needing-things-to-do-and-emails-patches :innocent: :no_mouth: )

snider@lt.hn my email OpenPGP key is on keyservers, also listed on GitHub and pasted below; best place to catch me is GitHub, make an issue, or talk to me in code :slight_smile:

GitHub will list people you can contact ( darbs@lt.hn will add his when he can ) (make a PR if you are not there/send me yours)... https://github.com/letheanVPN/blockchain/tree/main/openpgp.
