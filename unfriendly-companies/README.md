# NON-Crypto Friendly Companies

To save others time, wasting money vetting companies; im sahring the ones that give me trouble for just the term "blockchain"; 
Pro tip: never say "Secuirty" also... im sure i wouldnt have been refused product access, if i was a Anti Virus maker... ya know.


### The HOTH

Refused twice, on weird grounds... first time they could not do the PR i paid for, but with my money they let me use somthing else. 
I went for a refund; they paid it quickly. no complaints, they do clearly say no to my industory.

Emailed a second time, as they said they can do everything else BUT news distribution... fair enough... their reply; now they dont have my money, was 
"sorry we dont provide coding services"

Are you fucking joking me? i sear it was to get me all "upity" to be a "bad customer"; I can code.... Still looking for a content partner to turn my voice words into eye words...

### SecTigo

Trash; if ixplain why i'll get them in trouble. Dont use.
